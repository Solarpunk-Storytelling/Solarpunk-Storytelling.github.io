Q: Who are XR Wordsmiths? 

A: We are a band/collective of writers who are deeply concerned with the climate and ecological emergency facing us all. We are a part of Extinction Rebellion, and hail from all over the world.
Our writing is one way we battle against this emergency — we hope it spurs curiosity, concern, inspiration, reflection, love, rage, and also action. You’ll find all kinds of writing here, and a diversity of voices and styles, to remind us of the diversity of humankind and of our beautiful living earth.

Q: What is Solarpunk?  

A: Solarpunk is an art movement that envisions how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges, with an emphasis on sustainability problems such as [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) and [pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution), using only current technologies. It encompasses a multitude of media such as literature, fine arts, architecture, fashion, music, tattoos, and video games in a similar manner to adjacent movements such as [steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) and [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk) as well as more established art movements like [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque) and [Impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism). Punk of all kinds (including solarpunk) is about uplifting the downtrodden and including the excluded – including nonhumans.

Q: Can you recommend any Solarpunk books I can use for inspiration?

A: Absolutely!

_Sunvault: Stories of Solarpunk and Eco-Speculation_ – edited by Phoebe Wagner and Brontë Christopher Wieland (2017)

_Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Summers_ – Anthology edited by Sarena Ulibarri and Wendy Nikel (2018)

Q: Why are you focusing on optimistic visions for the future, when there is (unfortunately) so much inspiration for negative visions? 

A: Sci-fi is already bursting with imagined dystopias, and whilst these serve to warn us of and explore possible negative developments, they do not necessarily help us imagine how to avert them.

Q: Can I include illustrations with my story?

A: Yes! We welcome your illustrations – you can send them as attachments in your submission email to us. However, we will only be judging the text you send, not any images.

Q: Can I only submit one story?

A: You can submit as many stories as you like! Please submit all your stories in the same email.

Q: Will you accept co-authored submissions?

A: Yes! But please note that the prizes will have to be split between you. 

Q: Can I enter if I’ve entered before?

A: Yes. you can - we’re keen to showcase new talent, but we’re also very happy to welcome back those who participated in the last showcase - our primary aim is to help inspire a better future and to involve as many people as possible in doing that.
