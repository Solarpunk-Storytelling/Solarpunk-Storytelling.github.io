### Submission Instructions for our Younger Solarpunk Storytellers
We want your help imagining a healthy planet and world! As you know, the climate is in trouble and we are all working hard to make the earth healthier for ourselves, for animals, and for plants. If you had a crystal ball and could look into the future to see that healthier planet and world, what would it look like? We want to hear your visions of the future. “Solarpunk” is a kind of story that imagines a positive, happy future, with a healthy planet, kindness and equality, and cool climate technology. Can you write us a story about this healthy, happy world? For your story, think about: 
- climate-friendly inventions that have been created 
- how do humans take care of nature? 
- what are your city or school like? 
- how do we treat each other more fairly?

 We want to hear from you! And here's a secret, you don't need a crystal ball to know the future, you can create it yourself! 

To help your imagination take off, we've given you a few ideas to start with: 
1. You've invented a machine that allows you to talk to creatures, plants, rocks, and oceans-- what did you learn from them that helped you make the world better?
2. The Baron of Greed has taken over your town but help is on the way! How does Captain Solarpunk unite people, plants, and creatures to save the day?
3. You're a grandparent now. Tell your grandchildren the story of how people made the world a better place.

And here’s a word bank that might be helpful. These are words and ideas that will help make your story more Solarpunk so think about how you can use them in your story! 

**fairness, hydropower, solar, kindness, equality, windpower, recycling, harmony**

You do not have to use these ideas, they're there to get you started if you need help. So let your imagination fly!
