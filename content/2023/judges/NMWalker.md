Neil Walker is a retired health data scientist, now part of the UK's Extinction Rebellion's Data Analysis & Insights Circle, which aims to put the evidence into evidence-based climate activism.  Having borrowed his mother's library lending card - this was before YA literature was a thing - he has read voraciously since he was able, choosing books without much attention to genre. He now has a bad (or is that good?) second-hand book habit. However, positive alternative futures remain a firm favourite - which is where Solarpunk comes in!
