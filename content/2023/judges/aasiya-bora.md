Aasiya is a teacher, book-lover, Green Party campaigner, and ‘all-round eco-nut’. She always felt passionately that looking after
nature was something imperative and urgent - ever since her days as a teenager knocking on doors to collect money for wildlife sanctuaries from neighbours who said she was ‘too young’ and that they’d be ‘having a word’ with her parents. Aasiya’s favourite quote is "Love the animals. God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled. Don’t trouble them, don’t harass them, don’t deprive them of their happiness, don’t work against God’s intent.” (Fyodor
Dostoevsky).
