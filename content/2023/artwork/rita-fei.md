[Rita Fei](https://www.ritafei.com/) is an illustrator based in Vancouver, BC, and who graduated from Emily Carr University of Art and Design. She loves creating characters and worlds for the wonderfully broad spectrum of speculative fiction, and had a piece published in Spectrum 26. She is currently working full-time as a designer at Bardel Entertainment, and occasionally as a freelancer for various projects. Her entry for the Solarpunk Atomhawk competition was chosen as the title image for this Showcase.
