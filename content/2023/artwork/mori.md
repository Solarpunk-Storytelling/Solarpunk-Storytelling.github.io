[Mori](https://www.instagram.com/dream.mori/) is a digital artist from a small city in Chile. After studying Illustration and Graphic Design in DuocUC, she’s worked on several freelance projects: drawing characters for TV animations, illustrations for books and websites, t-shirt designs, prints, and posters. She’s also collaborated with several artists and participated in local Illustration fairs. Nowadays she is focused on creating new merch with the Dream.Mori signature. Mori is inspired by dreams, the unconscious and intrusive thoughts, which she combines to create evocative sensations through a digital canvas. Her favourite hobby is sculpting dolls with air-dry clay.
