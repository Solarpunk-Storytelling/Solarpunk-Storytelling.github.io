It all started when the world was filled with fumes and stuff like that. 
Until it was dawn that day… 
Do you know what happened? 
It all turned into candy. 
But luckily there were no more fumes! Instead of fumes there was candy floss. 
And surprisingly, when someone went to a tree they saw a rainbow straw and he drank from it and it was very sweet. 
But when he got home he grew fat! 
So he went back and he drank from it and he grew back to normal. 
Then he farted but it didn’t stink. 

The end.
Save the world.
