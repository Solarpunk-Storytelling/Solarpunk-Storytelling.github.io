One day, there was a young boy. He said, “I want to give the Earth a gift.” He thought about what he could give the Earth and then he decided to build 100 parks. His parks had colorful flowers and trees. The air was good. The boy was happy with his gift to Earth, even the animals had a good home. 

The Earth is our friend. We need parks and animals to live in it. We should plant trees and help the Earth have clean air. We should make small lakes for the fish and flowers for the bees and butterflies. We should create a nice, clean world.
