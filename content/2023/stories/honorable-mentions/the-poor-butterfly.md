If you were a bug, you would have a very sad life because some people kill bugs to make imprints. Some people catch bugs to bring them home. So, bugs are in danger and we need to protect them.

There was once the most beautiful butterfly living happily by herself, enjoying the pretty flowers. One day, a man caught her and took her home. He wanted to keep her in a jar and watch her every day. But, the butterfly didn’t have enough space to live so the butterfly died.

This story teaches us not to be mean to bugs or animals. We may be interested in them but we should let them live peacefully. Be careful what you catch and where you step. It’s very important.
