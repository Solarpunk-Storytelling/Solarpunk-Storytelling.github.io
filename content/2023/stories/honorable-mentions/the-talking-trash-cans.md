The trash cans are everywhere. They can talk and eat paper. Some trash cans can even eat plastic. They also teach us lessons. The trash cans say, “Don’t throw trash on the floor, please! Throw trash in the trash cans!”

The trash cans tell us their job is to keep the Earth clean. At night, the trash cans don’t sleep and the trash cans talk to people about not throwing trash on the floor. They keep saying, “Keep the Earth clean! Throw your trash away!”
