Age 7

Once upon a time, I saw a man using an ax to cut down trees. It made me feel sad.
I yelled, “Don’t use that ax! Cutting down trees will destroy the forest.” 

The man said “okay, I’ll stop.”

Then I saw that there were some flowers dying. They didn’t have water. So, I used some water and poured it on the flower. I also planted some more flowers and trees. 

The Earth is a big place but when people destroy it, it’s not okay. We shouldn’t litter or cut down trees. We should recycle and plant seeds. The end.
