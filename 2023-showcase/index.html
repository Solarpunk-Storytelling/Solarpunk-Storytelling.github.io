We had such an incredible response that we are organising another one. And so without further ado, we announce that the 2023 XR Solarpunk Showcase is live and ready for your entries!</p><p>Once again, we want to use our collective imagination as a tool against the climate and ecological emergency. Imagination unlocks the impossible and releases it into the realm of ‘possible’. Through radical re-imaginings of the world, we can get closer to creating a future which is positive and healthy for all life.</p><p>When you think about the future you want for the planet, what visions does your imagination conjure up? How would human societies interact with nature? How do you think a plant or an animal would describe its place in the world, and how it came to be so? What changes would transform today’s world into the world you imagine (from the smallest detail to large structural changes or technological innovations)? If we can imagine it, we can work towards it. The stories we received last year were sparked with imagination and innovation, you can read some of them <a href=https://www.solarpunkstorytelling.com/>here</a>.</p><p>This writing competition rides the wave of the Solarpunk movement – a genre of art and literature that envisions a future in which humanity, nature, and technology exist in harmony. Solarpunk’s main ethos lies in finding solutions for a more sustainable and egalitarian world through rebellion against the status quo. Read more about Solarpunk <a href=https://imposemagazine.com/bytes/cinema/the-definitive-guide-to-solarpunk-fashion-movies-aesthetic-more>here</a>.</p><p>Winners will have their stories published in the <a href=httsp://rebellion.global/news>XR Global blog</a>, <a href=https://solarpunkmagazine.com/>Solarpunk Magazine</a>, <a href=https://civilx.world/solar-punk-society/>Solarpunk Society Magazine</a>, and the <a href=https://www.shorelineofinfinity.com/>Shoreline of Infinity Science-Fiction Magazine</a>, and our official website. This is in addition to a range of other prizes, including:</p><ul><li>an illustration based on your story by one member of our team of amazing artists spread across the globe</li><li>interviews with Solarpunk figures</li><li>and (of course!) books</li></ul><p>Our prize pool is still growing and developing, so if you or your organization would like to collaborate somehow or donate something awesome, let us know!</p><p>Whether you are totally new to the world of eco-fiction or a seasoned enthusiast, this contest is open to any child, teenager, or adult who wants to combine their passion for writing with spreading the message about the climate and ecological emergency.

As you know, the climate is in trouble and we are all working hard to make the earth healthier for ourselves, for animals, and for plants. If you had a crystal ball and could look into the future to see that healthier planet and world, what would it look like? We want to hear your visions of the future. “Solarpunk” is a kind of story that imagines a positive, happy future, with a healthy planet, kindness and equality, and cool climate technology. Can you write us a story about this healthy, happy world? For your story, think about:</p><ul><li>climate-friendly inventions that have been created</li><li>how do humans take care of nature?</li><li>what are your city or school like?</li><li>how do we treat each other more fairly?</li></ul><p>We want to hear from you! And here&rsquo;s a secret, you don&rsquo;t need a crystal ball to know the future, you can create it yourself!</p><p>To help your imagination take off, we&rsquo;ve given you a few ideas to start with:</p><ol><li>You&rsquo;ve invented a machine that allows you to talk to creatures, plants, rocks, and oceans&ndash; what did you learn from them that helped you make the world better?</li><li>The Baron of Greed has taken over your town but help is on the way! How does Captain Solarpunk unite people, plants, and creatures to save the day?</li><li>You&rsquo;re a grandparent now. Tell your grandchildren the story of how people made the world a better place.</li></ol><p>And here’s a word bank that might be helpful. These are words and ideas that will help make your story more Solarpunk so think about how you can use them in your story! fairness, hydropower, solar, kindness, equality, windpower, recycling, harmony</p><p>You do not have to use these ideas, they&rsquo;re there to get you started if you need help. So let your imagination fly!</p><h3 id=faq>FAQ:</h3><p>Q: Who are XR Wordsmiths?</p><p>A: We are a band/collective of writers who are deeply concerned with the climate and ecological emergency facing us all. We are a part of Extinction Rebellion, and hail from all over the world.
Our writing is one way we battle against this emergency — we hope it spurs curiosity, concern, inspiration, reflection, love, rage, and also action. You’ll find all kinds of writing here, and a diversity of voices and styles, to remind us of the diversity of humankind and of our beautiful living earth.</p><p>Q: What is Solarpunk?</p><p>A: Solarpunk is an art movement that envisions how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges, with an emphasis on sustainability problems such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change>climate change</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution>pollution</a>, using only current technologies. It encompasses a multitude of media such as literature, fine arts, architecture, fashion, music, tattoos, and video games in a similar manner to adjacent movements such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk>steampunk</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk>cyberpunk</a> as well as more established art movements like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque>Baroque</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism>Impressionism</a>. Punk of all kinds (including solarpunk) is about uplifting the downtrodden and including the excluded – including nonhumans.</p><p>Q: Can you recommend any Solarpunk books I can use for inspiration?</p><p>A: Absolutely!

We welcome your illustrations – you can send them as attachments in your submission email to us. However, we will only be judging the text you send, not any images.</p><p>Q: Can I only submit one story?</p><p>A: You can submit as many stories as you like!
