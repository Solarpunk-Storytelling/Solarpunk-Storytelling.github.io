We are a part of Extinction Rebellion, and hail from all over the world.
Our writing is one way we battle against this emergency — we hope it spurs curiosity, concern, inspiration, reflection, love, rage, and also action. You’ll find all kinds of writing here, and a diversity of voices and styles, to remind us of the diversity of humankind and of our beautiful living earth.</p><p>Q: What is Solarpunk?</p><p>A: Solarpunk is an art movement that envisions how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges, with an emphasis on sustainability problems such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change>climate change</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution>pollution</a>, using only current technologies. It encompasses a multitude of media such as literature, fine arts, architecture, fashion, music, tattoos, and video games in a similar manner to adjacent movements such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk>steampunk</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk>cyberpunk</a> as well as more established art movements like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque>Baroque</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism>Impressionism</a>. Punk of all kinds (including solarpunk) is about uplifting the downtrodden and including the excluded – including nonhumans.</p><p>Q: Can you recommend any Solarpunk books I can use for inspiration?</p><p>A: Absolutely!
<em>Solarpunk: Ecological and Fantastical Stories in a Sustainable World</em> – Anthology edited by Gerson Lodi-Ribeiro, Translated by Fabio Fernandes (2012)</p><p><em>Sunvault: Stories of Solarpunk and Eco-Speculation</em> – edited by Phoebe Wagner and Brontë Christopher Wieland (2017)</p><p><em>Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Summers</em> – Anthology edited by Sarena Ulibarri and Wendy Nikel (2018)</p><p>Q: Why are you focusing on optimistic visions for the future, when there is (unfortunately) so much inspiration for negative visions?</p><p>A: Sci-fi is already bursting with imagined dystopias, and whilst these serve to warn us of and explore possible negative developments, they do not necessarily help us imagine how to avert them.</p><p>Q: Can I include illustrations with my story?</p><p>A: Yes! We welcome your illustrations – you can send them as attachments in your submission email to us. However, we will only be judging the text you send, not any images.</p><p>Q: Can I only submit one story?</p><p>A: You can submit as many stories as you like! Please submit all your stories in the same email.</p><p>Q: Will you accept co-authored submissions?</p><p>A: Yes! But please note that the prizes will have to be split between you.</p><p>Q: Can I enter if I’ve entered before?</p><p>A: Yes. you can - we’re keen to showcase new talent, but we’re also very happy to welcome back those who participated in the last showcase - our primary aim is to help inspire a better future and to involve as many people as possible in doing that.</p><br><br><br><br><br><img src=/images/rectangle-43-19@1x.png class=pencil><br><br><br><br><br></div></div></article></main><style>body{background-color:var(--hopbush);background-image:url(/images/light-green-ellipse.png);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:{ { .Params.ellipsexpos; } } { { .Params.ellipseypos; } }}a{color:var(--banana-mania)}h1{color:var(--banana-mania)}.dropdown-content{background-color:var(--jagged-ice)}.abouth{color:var(--banana-mania)}.floatingVillageContainer{margin:20px;margin-bottom:80px}.floatingVillageContainer img{width:100%;display:block}</style></body></html>
