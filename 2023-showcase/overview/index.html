We had such an incredible response that we are organising another one. And so without further ado, we announce that the 2023 XR Solarpunk Showcase is live and ready for your entries!</p><p>Once again, we want to use our collective imagination as a tool against the climate and ecological emergency. Imagination unlocks the impossible and releases it into the realm of ‘possible’. Through radical re-imaginings of the world, we can get closer to creating a future which is positive and healthy for all life.</p><p>When you think about the future you want for the planet, what visions does your imagination conjure up? How would human societies interact with nature? How do you think a plant or an animal would describe its place in the world, and how it came to be so? What changes would transform today’s world into the world you imagine (from the smallest detail to large structural changes or technological innovations)? If we can imagine it, we can work towards it. The stories we received last year were sparked with imagination and innovation, you can read some of them <a href=https://www.solarpunkstorytelling.com/>here</a>.</p><p>This writing competition rides the wave of the Solarpunk movement – a genre of art and literature that envisions a future in which humanity, nature, and technology exist in harmony. Solarpunk’s main ethos lies in finding solutions for a more sustainable and egalitarian world through rebellion against the status quo. Read more about Solarpunk <a href=https://imposemagazine.com/bytes/cinema/the-definitive-guide-to-solarpunk-fashion-movies-aesthetic-more>here</a>.</p><p>Winners will have their stories published in the <a href=httsp://rebellion.global/news>XR Global blog</a>, <a href=https://solarpunkmagazine.com/>Solarpunk Magazine</a>, <a href=https://civilx.world/solar-punk-society/>Solarpunk Society Magazine</a>, and the <a href=https://www.shorelineofinfinity.com/>Shoreline of Infinity Science-Fiction Magazine</a>, and our official website. This is in addition to a range of other prizes, including:</p><ul><li>an illustration based on your story by one member of our team of amazing artists spread across the globe</li><li>interviews with Solarpunk figures</li><li>and (of course!) books</li></ul><p>Our prize pool is still growing and developing, so if you or your organization would like to collaborate somehow or donate something awesome, let us know!</p><p>Whether you are totally new to the world of eco-fiction or a seasoned enthusiast, this contest is open to any child, teenager, or adult who wants to combine their passion for writing with spreading the message about the climate and ecological emergency.
