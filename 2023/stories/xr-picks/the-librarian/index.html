As a child in my mothers house. Silence. No cars, no
trucks on the road outside.</p><p>There is the silence and the singing of the birds. It must be Sunday. No school. Sleep
confuses me. I remember, with a shock. There is no school. There are no schools.
They have gone. I am not a child, the dreams are slipping away. The dreams that I can
just about touch are slipping away. Something is missing. The birds are calling. No
cars. I am remembering. My heart jolts with remembering. I am the only one.</p><p>I wake in the high glass tower of wind shattered windows and crumbling concrete.
Peering through the aisles glint the eyes of a fox. This is his home now. He stares at
me, curious before turning and disappearing between the shelves. Books, once
ordered, are strewn and windblown. Small birds flit in and out of the broken
windows. Tales spun from long extinguished imaginations remain here as words.</p><p>Humans imagining all that is possible. All those ideas now laid bare, unread, strewn
across the leaf swirled floor. Literature , stories. These books remain. All the others
are gone, burnt. Burnt not for ideology but for warmth, for survival during the
Great Unmaking.</p><p>It is dry here for now. The rain has not yet penetrated, but will one day. As all these
towers we built are gradually undone. Remade by rain and wind.</p><p>As I wake I wonder, as I always do, will there be another? It is a tiny thought now,
pushed to the back of my mind. So used am I to being here by myself, in this
fragmented world. A world which is now becoming so abundant with life. A world in
Recovery.</p><p>Now the humans are gone, life is thriving. Everywhere I travel the air hums with
the sound of living things. There are traces, of course, of the world before. It will
take some time for all those buildings and High Ways to be reabsorbed into the
fabric of the earth. But it is only a question of time.</p><p>So here I am, wondering as always, are there others or am I the only one? Why
should I survive when all others have gone? I remember the start of the Great
Unmaking, when the world&rsquo;s crops finally failed. The Great Failing when the Earths
weather systems changed beyond recognition. That was years ago now, days since
marked by the rising and falling of the sun, the spinning of the earth on her vast
orbit. Time measured by the longest and shortest shadows. Time marked from the
darkest point in the year.</p><p>A single consciousness, a single human consciousness.
We desperately covered the soil with liquid stone because we could not bear the fact
that one day we would not exist. We destroyed our beautiful world with our
thinking.</p><p>And yet a paradox. Our thinking was also a form of beauty. Our poetry, music, art,
science and our curiosity. We destroyed and created beauty in the same moment.
We ran with open eyes towards the abyss of our own making.</p><h3 id=ten-days-after-autumn-equinox>Ten Days after Autumn Equinox</h3><p>Light is emerging. I shelter on the fifth floor of the old central municipal library.
How can a species that knowingly destroys itself also safeguard its own stories?
Rain has cascaded for years now through the cracked and crumbling ceiling. Water
is not made or unmade. Its molecules have existed as long as the stars. It changes
form. It cannot be unmade.</p><p>I am on the fifth floor of this shattered building. Water pools from cracked windows
and seeps through the floor above. Books lie soaked in water, life reclaims them.
Moss has begun to consume them, tiny shoots taking hold in the soaked paper that
once were trees. Life has begun again. In fifty years there may be a small forest
within this building. Many books are here destroyed, their organic matter returning
to earth again.</p><p>Yet many books remain. It is these that I will re-order. There is safety and
protection still within these walls. In the driest area on this floor I will place the
remaining volumes. I will organise and categorise them. I may be the last but I may
not be.</p><p>I rest here on my journey, my journey to find home. I organise this fallen library. I
need stories. Although humans had managed to destroy almost all of themselves
they had such imagination and creativity. I would find the story places, the book
places. I would re-order their remains. So many books had been burnt for fuel in
those last times. Burnt for warmth under black skies. I would leave a trail of order
through the carnage we had created.</p><p>We watched while the world tumbled around us, distracted by flickering screens. It
was all predicted, known well in advance. The science was all there, fully
understood, yet ignored. Ignored by the politicians and the public alike. It was too
much to fathom.</p><p>Someone would be taking care of it, taking care of us. Yet there was no-one. No-one
but us and we did nothing. Who was steering the ship? The fossil fuel companies.
Except the companies were not beings. The people running the fossil fuel
companies, running blindly to the dark edge.</p><p>And us. Who did nothing. There were protests and campaigns of urgency, but our
governments, those who we voted for to look after us, were themselves making too
much money from the oil and gas that was killing our planet to take the action that
was needed to save us.</p><p>Such deep sorrow. Deep sorrow that we had the opportunity. The opportunity for
change. Can I really be the only one? The one to remember? And when I am gone,
will the humans be gone? Leaving only this beautiful wild world, which is fast regenerating itself. Forests are spreading year on year with the absence of humans.</p><p>Life returns where before there was concrete and steel.</p><h3 id=twenty-seven-days-after-autumn-equinox>Twenty seven Days after Autumn Equinox</h3><p>The sun creeps over the horizon. The landscape unfolds through broken glass.
Where concrete once towered above, broken walls now crumble. Roots of plants
invade every crevice, take hold and begin to dismember everything we created.
Water seeps through tiny cracks and washes away molecule by tiny molecule this
lifeless dead matter we built. What we created was not living. We took life and
sucked it dry, leaving only parched cracked bones.</p><p>We rebuilt the world into one we could rationalise, comprehend. Keep infinity at bay,
at arm’s length. Hide in the shadows of our existence. Not the world we actually
inhabited, where our existence was miraculous and time was without end. Infinite
time, infinite space. This reality we cannot fathom.</p><p>Existence and our own non existence. Within infinite time lay our own non being.
Our minds were not yet ready to fathom this reality. We desperately covered the soil
with stone because we could not bear the fact that one day we would not exist. Too
much distance, too much space. So we created walls to contain ourselves, comfort
ourselves. We destroyed our beautiful world with our thinking. We destroyed and
created beauty in the same moment.</p><p>Birds as always outside. Air is crisp and clear, through the shattered library
window. I arrange books into piles on the floor. Reference and fiction. Arranging the
fiction alphabetically, ready to be replaced in order on the waiting shelves. All these
stories and images transported from one mind to another. Right now there is only
my mind, but there may be others. Since the beginnings of human consciousness we
have transferred stories from one mind into another’s. It is the closest we have to
seeing through the eyes of someone else. As we hear a story it is recreated in our
mind, retold by us to ourselves. When I am gone will these stories remain? They
remain as words on paper, as material matter, but without someone to read the
words, do they really exist?</p><h3 id=midwinter>Midwinter</h3><p>Still I wake with the dread. It cannot be that I am the only one. Still after years, it
cannot only be me. There must be others in other parts of the earth that are living
still. But how can I know? Weather shifted by us. Floods, crop failure, destruction.</p><p>Not acts of god. Acts of Man. Acts of man knowingly undertaken in full knowledge of
what he was doing. Distracted by our glowing screens and playlists, swiping
through news while the world collapsed around us.</p><p>My days at this library are coming to a close. The books are almost reordered. If
someone does come one day, they will know they were not alone.</p><p>I need to return. My home was my fathers home, far up north, deep in a valley,
surrounded by purple mountains. I was far from there, but I felt a pull, the pull of
childhood, of longing to return. I had not been there for many years, but I could
picture the valley, the road we drove along in our dirty oil burning car, following the
iridescent river. Then over an arched stone bridge and into the village.</p><p>There will be snow on the moors outside the city. I make preparations for the
journey. I have found the maps I need, the way is clear. I will walk the highway for
several weeks, more if the weather is bad. Then find the smaller road into the
Mountains.</p><p>That was where I needed to be, and walking would be the only way. It lay far North
and West. I would follow the old concrete High Ways and find my path. There are
now so many trees.</p><h3 id=thirty-days-after-midwinter>Thirty Days after Midwinter</h3><h3 id=eighteen-years-after-the-great-unmaking>Eighteen Years after the Great Unmaking</h3><p>Panic startles me from sleep. Even when there were others, we were all alone. Yet
that somehow also bound us together on our journey. Am I the last to see this vast
beautiful spinning wilderness? The last to see the beauty of this earth and feel the
loss of what we have done to ourselves? I cannot comprehend what we have done.
We lived in paradise and yet for us it was not enough. We thought we could do better.
As the light returns I must walk again.</p><p>The snow crackles crisp on the ground underfoot. Ice is treacherous under my
boots. Ravens circle, hover in the grey sky above, their cackle and craw shredding
the silent air, echo from the crumbling walls of the old city outskirts. I am above the
city, on that high outlook known in the old code as the M6. It is easier walking up
here than the wild tangle of growth below. There are holes in this hard road, where
concrete and steel have collapsed, cracked by the ice and torrents of incessant rain
during the Unmaking. This crumbling concrete roadway rises high over trees and
bramble and long abandoned houses below. It was the machines that used to carry
people. Humans of the North did not walk. They were carried everywhere, they did
so little for themselves.</p><p>Now they have gone, the sound of life is almost deafening. Humans had their
creativity and their love. But it was drowned , silenced by their love of rage and war.
As I rest on the icy road tarmac and cement are being ground by water back to their
constituent forms, returning gradually to their elements. Stone and earth. A tiny
brook of half frozen water bubbles along the cracked concrete.</p><p>There was no destiny ordained by a god that humans should survive. No script
written in the stars that humans will remain. That was up to us. Our responsibility
to live on this finite earth. It was our decision. The fact that we existed was a
miracle. The fact that life existed anywhere was miraculous. We existed in paradise,
paradise surrounded us yet we could not see it. Terrified by the miracle of our own
existence we destroyed the very earth, the beautiful world we inhabited that
allowed us to live. We severed the arteries of the earth because we could not bear
the painful beauty of our own existence in this fragile world.</p><h3 id=fifty-four-days-after-midwinter>Fifty Four Days After Midwinter</h3><p>The sky is dark, the air crisp. The thick blanket keeps my blood warm. This is what
wakes me with a jolt in the dark hours before the light emerges once again. They
knew. They knew that if they did not stop burning the earth would shift. Shift
beyond recognition and yet they did not stop. And now they are gone. Carried into
oblivion as their burning changed everything.</p><p>I am surrounded by stars far above me. This earth, fragile beautiful air skinned
globe spinning not in a void, but a vast expanse of inter related planets and
galaxies. It seems so strange now that we could not see it before, when it was right
here all along. We were actually living in heaven. Our home was paradise. With the
absence of humans, Life was returning. The miracle of existence is in the air that we
breathe and the soil that we so desperately covered with tar.</p><p>The days are creeping back again. Slowly, very slowly, the days lengthen. Days are
gradually longer, nights are shorter.</p><p>When the sun rises, I will walk. The mountains are calling.</p><img src=/images/rectangle-43-19@1x.png class=story__pencil></div></div></div></article></main><style>body{--paramsBGColor:var(--);--paramsTitleColor:var(--, var(--banana-mania));--paramsEllipseColor:var(--);--paramsTextBackgroundColor:var(--);--bgColor:var(--paramsBGColor, var(--hopbush-3));--titleColor:var(--paramsTitleColor, var(--banana-mania));--ellipseColor:var(--paramsEllipseColor, var(--jordy-blue));--bgEllipse:url();--storyBgColor:var(--paramsTextBackgroundColor, var(--jordy-blue))}</style><script src=/js/index.js defer></script></body></html>
