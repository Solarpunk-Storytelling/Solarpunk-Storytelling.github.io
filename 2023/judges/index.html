After completing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, she started working as a mechanical engineer, building computer models to help designers make their products better, and now looking for ways to make them more sustainable. In her spare time, she loves immersing herself in the other worlds that books bring.</p></div></section><section class=judges__section><div class=judges__img-col></div><div class=judges__col><h2>Katrina Eilender</h2><p>Katrina Eilender is one of our 2021 Showcase Winners!</p></div></section><section class=judges__section><div class=judges__img-col><img src=/images/judges/2023/lea%20cortas.JPG class=judges__img alt="Lea Cortas"></div><div class=judges__col><h2>Lea Cortas</h2><p>Lea Cortas grew up in Lebanon and is now attending Amsterdam University College where she studies film.

In her academic life, she focuses on population ecology, dispersal, and animal movement in the marine environment - all in front of a laptop because she works in silica, meaning building computer models to do all kinds of fancy things. Her writing life is mostly lived on her YouTube channel Ecofictology, where she talks all about reading and writing eco-fiction and how it can be used as a science communication tool. She hopes to continue bridging these two worlds as she tries to find a way to bring her science to the widest audience possible.</p></div></section><section class=judges__section><div class=judges__img-col></div><div class=judges__col><h2>Mona Damluji</h2><p>Dr. Mona Damluji is an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying oil culture and cinema history in the Middle East. She is the author of the amazing children’s book “Together”, a story of the power of collective action.</p></div></section><section class=judges__section><div class=judges__img-col><img src=/images/judges/2023/NMWalker-headshot-2023.png class=judges__img alt="Neil Walker"></div><div class=judges__col><h2>Neil Walker</h2><p>Neil Walker is a retired health data scientist, now part of the UK&rsquo;s Extinction Rebellion&rsquo;s Data Analysis & Insights Circle, which aims to put the evidence into evidence-based climate activism. Having borrowed his mother&rsquo;s library lending card - this was before YA literature was a thing - he has read voraciously since he was able, choosing books without much attention to genre. He now has a bad (or is that good?) second-hand book habit. However, positive alternative futures remain a firm favourite - which is where Solarpunk comes in!</p></div></section></div></article></main><style>body{--bgColor:var(--vivid-violet);--titleColor:var(--jagged-ice);--ellipseColor:var(--);--bgEllipse:url();--grad:radial-gradient(circle at 50% 150vh, var(--ellipseColor, var(--jordy-blue)) 70vw, transparent 0)}</style><script src=/js/index.js defer></script></body></html>
